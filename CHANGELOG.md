# Changelog

Toolkit versions (`system-spec --version`) are independent of a modeled system's `system.version`. Spec files stay valid across releases when changes only add optional fields; a validator older than a field rejects specs that use it.

## Unreleased

- `Component.test_paths` and `COMP-08` (verification): test evidence for a component that declares `test_paths` must come from files under them. Opt-in; existing specs unaffected. Specs using `test_paths` need a validator that includes it.
- `--check-drift` also scans `test_paths`; `--check-artifacts` verifies they exist.
- New [`examples/components/`](examples/components/README.md): standalone components with their own tests.

## 0.2.0

- `--check-drift --root`: Python imports between components vs `requires`/`bindings`; JSON Schema properties vs data model fields.
- `WIRING.md`: uv install, schema modeline, CI gate, path anchoring, skill link rewrite, adoption guidance.

## 0.1.0

- First release: validator CLI (`system-spec`), JSON Schema, offline `export`, workflows, examples and skills.
