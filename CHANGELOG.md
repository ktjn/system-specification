# Changelog

Toolkit versions (`system-spec --version`) are independent of a modeled system's `system.version`. Spec files stay valid across releases when changes only add optional fields; a validator older than a field rejects specs that use it.

Every entry ends with `Migrate:` — what an adopting project must do to upgrade (`none` when existing specs, commands and CI keep working unchanged; otherwise the concrete edits or commands, e.g. regenerate `schema.json`, rename a field, add a flag).

## Unreleased

- Added: with `--check-report --report-scope evidence` a test may back several requirements: bindings are optional, and any a cited test has (or a test under a cited file or selector) must include the record's `requirement@version`; `--test-map` `verifies` (and a map value) may be a list, and `--emit-evidence` yields one record per binding. The default strict scope still requires exactly one binding (#218). Migrate: none.
- Changed: `--render-docs` `contracts` lists each failure mode with its `interface.errors` entry (`card_declined → charge.declined`; a plain name when there is none) (#217). Migrate: none; re-run `--render-docs` to refresh rendered documents.
- Changed: `--check-test-names` also requires the module segments of `<file>::<module>::<name>` to be declared in the file, in order (`mod X` in `.rs`, `class X` in `.py`, otherwise as identifiers), so a wrong module path is caught (#215). Migrate: none, unless `--check-test-names` now reports a wrong module path in a `<file>::<module>::<name>` provenance; correct the module.
- Changed: releases: every `Unreleased` entry must end with `Migrate:` (the upgrade steps, or `none`); CI (`release_support.py --check-changelog`) and the `publish` plan reject entries without it. Migrate: none for adopting projects; contributors add `Migrate:` to their entries.

## 0.10.0

- Added: `--check-report` matches `test` evidence citing a test file (`tests/kv.rs`) or a runner selector in `test_paths` (`nextest::-p store`) to the reported tests under it: present when any matches, in agreement when all passed and any binding is the record's requirement; `--selector-prefix SELECTOR=PREFIX` maps other selectors to report-ID prefixes (nextest `-p NAME` built in); those tests count as named by evidence for `--report-scope evidence` (#211).
- Changed: `--render-docs` `requirements` shows each criterion as `id: text` (not the bare ID), and `risks` gains Description, Owner and Waives with its expiry; `report:risks` and `--report risks` keep the compact table (#210).
- Added: `--render-docs` kinds `layers` (declared order, internal components and their `source_paths`) and `domains` (description, `uses`, internal components) (#209).
## 0.9.0

- Changed: releases: `Unreleased` entries start with `Breaking:`, `Added:`, `Changed:` or `Fixed:` (CI checks it) and raise the suggested version above the public-surface check (`Added:` minor, `Breaking:` major); the `publish` plan is also printed in the job log and as an annotation, so a dry run shows its result.
- Added: `--render-docs` kinds: `requirements` gains Status (`specified (proposed)`) and Applies to; new `evidence` (one row per record: requirement, subject, criteria, method, provenance, run, verifier, result) and `status` (counts, open requirement IDs, runs, risks and waivers, bound subjects); `components` gains test requires, owned data and source paths; `capabilities` provider and auth; `data-models` derived from and schema (#202).
- Changed: Compatibility: `--check-artifacts`, `--check-isolation`, `--check-drift` and `--check-imports` without `--stage` or `--compat` run only the requested checks, whatever their result (before, `--check-artifacts` also ran the release stage when it passed); give `--stage` to run a stage too. A binding hash-mismatch message leaves out empty `stale requirements -; stale evidence -` parts (#201).
- Changed: `--check-imports`: a vendored `imports/<id>.yaml` is also used when `path` leaves `--root` (not only when it is missing), and every message names the file actually read, e.g. `sha256 mismatch for spec/imports/pay.yaml (vendored copy; declared path …)`, likewise for `--import-path` (#200).
- Added: `--test-map` entries may be `{verifies: requirement@version, test: <file>::<name>}`: the report ID is then treated as that `test` ID (and its file), so evidence matches runners whose JUnit IDs are `<binary-id>::<name>` (cargo-nextest) without rewriting the report; string entries unchanged. Not included: selector-aware provenance matching (#199).
- Added: `--render-docs`: a block may select its own spec, `<!-- system-spec: KIND spec=PATH -->` (relative to the Markdown file, loaded and structurally validated once per run), so one document can cover a spec and the spec importing it; blocks without `spec=` render as before (#198).
- Changed: Releases: `publish` has a `plan` job that suggests the version (major if a public invariant ID, CLI option or schema property was removed since the last tag, minor if added, else patch; `bump` overrides, `dry_run` previews), stops on an empty `Unreleased`, and a re-run resumes a pushed release (`release_support.py`); CI requires a changelog entry when `metamodel.py` or a schema changes.
- Changed: Releases run from one `publish` workflow dispatch (bump, changelog, tag, PyPI, GitHub release with digests); RELEASING.md.

## 0.8.0

Compatibility: all additions are optional (`Criterion.threshold`, `Evidence.measurements`, `runs`, `Evidence.run`); existing specs validate unchanged. Specs that use them need this validator.

- `--impact`: evidence of an `applies_to` requirement is invalidated only for subjects the change reaches (all of it when the requirement is the target); the requirement is still listed (#177).
- Optional `Criterion.threshold` (`metric`, `op`, `value`, `unit`) and `Evidence.measurements`; new `EV-09` (verification) checks `passed` agrees with the measurements and passing evidence records the metric; `--evidence-report` lists measured values (93 invariants). Regenerate `schema.json` and `fragment.schema.json` (#176).
- Optional `runs` (`Run`: `id`, `subject_revision`, `subject_version`, `artifacts`, `timestamp`, `verifier`, `environment`) and `Evidence.run`: a record inherits the fields it leaves unset from its run on load, replacing YAML anchors; unknown run is `REF-15` (92 invariants). Regenerate `schema.json` and `fragment.schema.json`. Not included: per-run `--evidence-report` and `--emit-evidence` grouping (#175).
- SHA-256 fields (`subject_bindings`/evidence/baseline `artifacts`, `imports[].sha256`, view and experience reference `sha256`) reject a YAML number with "SHA-256 must be a quoted string (YAML read it as a number)"; no coercion, since leading zeros are lost or read as octal (#174).
- `--check-imports --import-path ID=FILE` (repeatable) and a vendored `imports/<id>.yaml` next to the spec (used when `path` is missing) supply an imported spec without a sibling checkout; the pin's `sha256` verifies it (#173).
- `--impact` and `--plan` accept imported capability IDs (`<import>:<capability>`), seeded with the components that `requires` or `test_requires` them (#172).
- `--check-artifacts --check-test-names`: a `<file>::<name>` test provenance must name a test found in the file (textual identifier match, opt-in) (#171).
- `--bind [SUBJECT…] --revision REV --root R [--include GLOB…]` prints `subject_bindings` (and refreshed evidence `artifacts` digests) from the provider's tracked source files, refusing when they differ from `REV`; BROWNFIELD.md § Keeping a bound spec current (#170).
- `--check-artifacts`: a `subject_bindings` hash mismatch names the subject, the requirements targeting it and the evidence bound to it that are stale, in the message and as `stale` with `--json` (#169).
- `--impact-paths PATH…` (`-` reads stdin): impact of changed files, mapped to components through `source_paths`/`test_paths`; `--impact` output gains `tests` (test paths and selectors of affected components), `--impact-paths` adds `changed_components` and `unmapped_paths` (#168).
- `--render-docs FILE… [--check]` regenerates marker-delimited Markdown blocks (element tables, `report:*`, `diagram:*`) from the model with GitHub-safe cells; `--check` fails on stale files (#167). `--report risks` cells are escaped too.
- `--check-drift --deps FILE`: language-neutral dependency graph (packages with paths, `normal|dev|build` edges) checked like source imports against `requires`, `bindings` and `test_requires`; unowned packages are `unchecked` (#166).
- `--check-report --report-scope evidence` checks only tests named by `test` evidence and reports the rest as a count (brownfield adoption); `--test-map FILE` binds tests to `requirement@version` for `--check-report` and `--emit-evidence`, for runners without per-test properties (#165).
- `--report` honours `--json` (coverage: one object per breakdown keyed by dimension; risks: row objects); coverage tables get `### By <dimension>` headings; priority and mandatory breakdowns with a single value are omitted (#164).
- `--diagram components`: an external component's `API:` label omits capabilities reached only through `test_requires` (#163).
- `via` (`REF-05`) accepts version-constrained references (`base:txn@^1.0`) on either side, resolved like `requires`; the constraint is ignored for the mapping (#162).
- `--diagram hierarchy` and `--diagram risks` render left-to-right (`graph LR`): siblings stack vertically, so large specs stay readable instead of very wide; `components` and `runtime` stay top-to-bottom (#158).
- `--check-report --root R --test-glob PATTERN`: every file matching a project-supplied pattern under a component's `test_paths` needs at least one reported test (file from the `file` property/attribute or the `<file>::` prefix of the `test` property); runner-independent, opt-in.

## 0.7.0

Compatibility: all additions are optional (`Interface.publish`, `Requirement.applies_to`); existing specs validate unchanged. Specs that use them need this validator.

- `--diagram runtime`: flow view (components boxed by domain inside the system, externals outside; edges labelled with `interface.operation`, wrapped and merged when parallel; caller → provider, `async` dashed; `via` drawn through the mediator, `via` on a `publish: true` interface drawn publisher → mediator → subscriber; no layers or data). All `--diagram` kinds render top-to-bottom (tested). `--help` and README list every kind with its default (#150).
- `Interface.publish` (optional, default `false`): the provider publishes events that consumers subscribe to; existing specs validate unchanged.
- Feedback must not leak project specifics: README § Giving feedback, `CONSTITUTION.md` self-improvement step 4, agent instructions (`AGENTS.md`, `WIRING.md`) and an issue template with a checkbox (#152).
- System-wide requirements (#135 follow-up): optional `Requirement.applies_to` (`Selector`: `kind`, `has_interface`, `domain`, `layer`, `external`) on a system-targeted requirement; each selected entity needs passing evidence naming it as `subject_id`; `--evidence-report` lists selected and uncovered entities; `REQ-11` (inventory). Existing specs validate unchanged; specs using it need this validator.
- CI: package job runs on Ubuntu with the latest Python only; GitHub Actions updated to Node 24 versions; Dependabot added for Actions and uv lockfiles. `PKG-09` v1.1 drops Windows and 3.12.

## 0.6.0

Compatibility: all additions are optional or opt-in (`Criterion`, `holder`, `evidence_policy`, `evidence_methods`, `release_scope`, `SpecImport.mode: baseline`); existing specs validate unchanged and `SpecImport.capabilities` now defaults to `{}`. New invariants apply only when their feature is used (`REQ-10`, `EV-07`, `EV-08`). Specs that use them need this validator.

- `--evidence-report` (#113): per active requirement version, the validator's own verification state (verified, failing/uncovered criteria, blanket and skipped records, methods, holder, priority). Opt-in `system.evidence_policy.require_criteria`: records without `criteria` are an error at verification (`EV-08`) and no longer cover the whole requirement.
- Test-only dependencies (#127): optional `Component.test_requires` resolves like `requires` (`COMP-04`) and satisfies `--check-drift` for integration-scoped test edges, but is exempt from `COMP-05`, `COMP-06`, `DOM-02`, context slices and fakes; `COMP-11` forbids it on external components.
- Release scope (#114): `system.release_scope` or `--release-scope P0[,P1]` limits release obligations (`STAT-04`, `REQ-04`–`REQ-06`, `REQ-08`, `RISK-04`, `EXP-07`) to in-scope priorities; out-of-scope requirements, their target entities, the components providing those and risks only they mitigate are reported `deferred`, never passed.
- Obligation holder (#115): optional `Requirement.holder`; `system.evidence_methods` maps holders to allowed evidence methods (`EV-07`).
- Criterion IDs (#116): a criterion may be `{id, text}`; evidence and handoff results name it by ID or text; IDs unique per requirement (`REQ-10`).
- Baseline imports (#117): `SpecImport.mode: baseline` with `artifacts`, `allow_fields`, `id_prefix` and `refinements` (`path`, `reason`, `decision`); `--check-imports` reports undeclared changes or removals of baseline requirements, risks, views, experiences and state sets, and stale refinements.
- `--diagram`: layer boxes are dashed (`style l_<layer> stroke-dasharray:6 4`), so they are distinguishable from the solid domain boxes nested inside them.

Compatibility: `EXP-09` to `EXP-12` are new verification-stage invariants for `critical` experiences (`EXP-09`/`EXP-10` only when also `exhaustive`); specs with experiences can need added interactions or scenarios. Commands combining `--check-*` with an explicit `--stage` or `--compat` now also run the stage and can fail where they printed `VALID` before.

- Fixed: `--check-drift`, `--check-imports` and `--check-isolation` (and `--check-artifacts` on failure) silently dropped an explicit `--stage`/`--compat`. They now run together and report all errors.
- Experience feedback from the Observable 2.0 adoption ([record](archive/feedback/observable-2.0-adoption.md)): `EXP-09` (view actions trigger interactions), `EXP-10` (view-specific states are reached), `EXP-11` (each failure mode's state is reached by a negative scenario of that interaction), `EXP-12` (negative scenarios exercise one interaction; scenario states lie on their interactions' views). Example `examples/experience/` updated.
- Docs: GREENFIELD.md § Planned components and § Adopting an upstream specification; FEATURE.md rules on gating spec-only changes and building on the validator's evidence evaluation; EXPERIENCE.md scenario guidance and the limit of structural checks.
- Distributed specs: `SpecImport.link` (owning repository URL, no revision), `Workspace`/`Member` manifest (`Member.stage` per-member override) and `--workspace [--stage]` cross-member checks (member validation, import pins, link agreement, unique system IDs, acyclic imports); `--check-imports` hints `(clone <link>)` for a missing checkout. [WORKSPACE.md](WORKSPACE.md).
- Hierarchical specs (#124): `Component.realized_by: <import-id>` (black-box subsystem realized by a child spec), optional `system.exports` (exported capability surface; default all), cross-level requirement links (`<import-id>:<requirement-id>` in `depends_on` and `refines`), and `--check-imports` boundary verification (contract inclusion `child.provides ⊇ component.provides`, `child.external_requires ⊆ component.requires`, capability/data compatibility, cross-spec requirement verification, and child release maturity for verified in-scope components).
- Docs: GREENFIELD.md § First iteration.
- Docs: [MODERNIZATION.md](MODERNIZATION.md) track and [mechanism decision template](templates/MODERNIZATION-DECISION.md); [`ddd`](.github/skills/ddd/SKILL.md) skill; test-first unit tests bind to component sub-requirements (CONSTITUTION.md § Traceability, FEATURE.md). Feedback: [record](archive/feedback/modernization-feedback.md).
- Proposals: #113 evidence report and criterion-coverage policy, #114 release scope by priority, #115 obligation holder, #116 criterion IDs, #117 baseline import mode.

## 0.5.0

Compatibility: component isolation is opt-in (`standalone_harness`, `provided_mocks`, `--check-isolation`); existing specs validate unchanged. `--check-isolation` executes project code from `--root`; run it only on trusted repositories.

- Component isolation ([`COMPONENT-ISOLATION.md`](COMPONENT-ISOLATION.md)): `Component.standalone_harness` and `Component.provided_mocks` (`MockBinding`: `path`, `contract_suite`, `scenarios`); `--check-isolation --root` runs each harness with dependency fakes and each provided capability's contract suite against the real provider and its programmable mock. Example: [`examples/components/`](examples/components/README.md).
- Docs: [`REPLACEMENT.md`](REPLACEMENT.md) (implementation replacement); greenfield/brownfield convergence clarified.

Compatibility: additions to the optional experience extension; existing experience specs validate unchanged. Specs that use the new fields need this validator.

- Experience feedback from the observability-spec pilot (#99 to #106): `Scenario.requirements` (several requirements, all must pass); `Experience.entries` and `Interaction.from_entry` (starts that are not views); `Spec.state_sets` and `View.state_sets` (shared view states); `Constraint` (`value`, `requirement`) in `Experience.constraints`; `VisualReference.consistent_with`; `Experience.exhaustive` and `not_exercised` with new `EXP-08`. `EXP-02` and `EXP-07` cover the new references. Documented in-view actions as self-transitions and the split between failure modes and invariants.
Compatibility: the experience extension is optional; specs without `views` and `experiences` validate unchanged. Specs that use it need this validator.

- Optional experience specification ([`EXPERIENCE.md`](EXPERIENCE.md), `spec.md` § 13): `Spec.views` and `Spec.experiences` (interactions, view-scoped states, scenarios, visual references with illustrative/normative authority). Invariants `EXP-01` to `EXP-07`, applied only to declared experiences; `--check-artifacts` checks reference files. Example: [`examples/experience/`](examples/experience/README.md). Addresses issue #97 (adoption steps 1-3).
Compatibility: all additions are optional; existing specs validate unchanged. Specs that use the new fields need this validator (older ones reject unknown fields). `REQ-09` applies only where `superseded_by` is set.

- `Requirement.statement`, `priority`, `owner` and `superseded_by`; `description` on `Capability`, `Component` and `Risk`; `owner` on `Component` and `Risk`. `priority` has no effect on invariants and is listed by `--plan`. `REQ-09` (inventory): `superseded_by` is set only on deprecated requirements and names an active requirement.
- `system.verification_categories` narrows `REQ-01` to a project profile; omitted categories are reported (`omitted_categories` with `--json`, a `note:` line otherwise).
- Docs: `refines` means co-obligation (`REQ-08`); use `depends_on` across priority or phase.
- Example: [`examples/business/`](examples/business/README.md), a business-level specification validated at `verification`.
- Docs: [`FEATURE.md`](FEATURE.md) § Decompose and hand off states the requirement-first order, sub-requirement split per component, wave-based parallelism, handoff bundle and join in one place; no behavior change.
- Docs: [`FEATURE.md`](FEATURE.md) § Using with OpenSpec maps an OpenSpec change workflow onto the feature steps; no integration is provided.
- Skill [`quint`](.github/skills/quint/SKILL.md): Quint models (typecheck, `run` simulation as `analysis`, `verify` bounded check as `model-check`) recorded as Evidence.
Compatibility: `REQ-08` is a new release-stage invariant. Specs where a mandatory or mitigating requirement is refined (`refines`) by a requirement without passing evidence now fail at `release`; the new flags are opt-in.

- `REQ-08` (release): obligation passes to refining requirements (sub-requirements), and obligated or mitigating requirements are verified only when every sub-requirement is. A parent still needs its own (integration) evidence.
- `--check-report JUNIT` / `--emit-evidence JUNIT`: tests bind exactly one requirement version through a `verifies` JUnit property; `test` evidence must agree with the run reports and can be derived from them. `reference-implementation/conftest.py` shows a pytest `verifies` marker.
- Docs: [`MODEL-SCOPE.md`](MODEL-SCOPE.md) states that the metamodel is conceptual and platform independent; methodology and the reference validator are optional, and acceptance policy belongs to the consuming project.

## 0.4.0

Compatibility: all additions are optional or opt-in (`imports`, `include`, `domain`, `external`, `via`, `test_scope`, `Evidence.criteria`); existing specs validate unchanged. Specs that use them need a 0.4.0+ validator (older ones reject unknown fields). New invariants apply only when their feature is used (`IMP-01`, `EV-06`, `COMP-11`, `DOM-*`).

- Fixed: `system-spec export` no longer copies `__pycache__`/`.pyc` files that pip generates inside the installed toolkit.
- `--check-drift` now lists components without `source_paths` as `unchecked` instead of passing them silently.
- `--export backstage|structurizr`: Backstage catalog entities and a Structurizr DSL workspace from the spec (`--owner` for Backstage).
- Cross-spec references (`MKT-FB-01`): `system.imports` (`SpecImport`) pins another spec; `<import>:<capability>` is provided by external components and required by consumers without copying contracts; `IMP-01` (inventory); `--check-imports --root` verifies pins against the imported spec. Specs using `imports` need a validator that includes it.
- `Evidence.criteria` and `EV-06` (inventory): evidence can cover individual requirement criteria; a requirement is verified when every criterion is covered by passing evidence, and `REQ-04`/`REQ-05` name failing or uncovered criteria (`SCL-FB-05`). Records without criteria behave as before. Handoff return results accept `criteria` the same way.
- Handoff return: `HandoffReturn` model, `handoff-return.schema.json`, `--return-schema` and `--check-return FILE`: structured agent results (requirement-linked results, unmet with reasons, changed paths, findings) checked against the spec and component scope.
- `--check-drift` scans JS/TS imports (`import`/`export from`/`require`/dynamic `import()`), following relative specifiers and workspace package names from `package.json`; same rules as Python (declared dependency, tests use fakes).
- `system.domains` (`id`, `description`, `uses`) and `Component.domain` (optional): domains are orthogonal to layers (n:m). `DOM-01` declared, `DOM-02` cross-domain dependencies in `uses` (waiver `domain-violation`), `DOM-03` acyclic `uses`. `--diagram` nests domains inside layers. Addresses `SCL-FB-01`, `SCL-FB-02`.
- `Component.external` and `COMP-11` (architecture): providers outside the system (platforms, third-party APIs) declare contracts only; exempt from layers, domains, budgets and tests; drift targets whose own sources are not scanned; `--diagram` draws them as hexagons outside the system. Addresses `MKT-FB-01`.
- `Component.via` (`REF-05`): runtime-mediated dependencies name their mediating capability; listed as `unchecked` by `--check-drift`, dashed in `--diagram`. Addresses `MKT-FB-02`.
- `Component.test_scope: integration`: exempts assembly/end-to-end tests from `COMP-09` and lets them depend on providers of required capabilities in `--check-drift`; components without `source_paths` are listed as `unchecked`. Addresses `MKT-FB-03`.
- Split specs: `include` patterns in the root spec merge fragment files (any section except `system`); `fragment.schema.json` and `--fragment-schema` for editors. New optional `include` key on the root; `examples/components/` is now split. Specs using `include` need a validator that includes it.

## 0.3.0

Compatibility: all additions are optional or opt-in (`test_paths`, `fakes`, `Evidence.environment`); existing specs validate unchanged. Specs that use these fields need a 0.3.0+ validator (older ones reject unknown fields). Declaring `fakes` or `test_paths` activates `COMP-08` to `COMP-10`.

- `COMP-10` (release): a capability that a consumer fakes needs a verified `contract` requirement at its provider. Existing specs unaffected unless they declare `fakes`.
- `Evidence.environment` (optional): host/OS/CI job, distinguishing local from remote runs (`SCL-FB-06`).
- `--plan <id>`: provider-first delivery waves for a change, with per-component bindings and evidence to revisit.
- `--check-scope <component> --changed <file|->`: fails when a change touches paths outside the component's source/test/fake/schema paths (handoff scope guard).
- `test_paths`/`fakes` accept `tool::selector` entries for package-level runners (e.g. `nextest::-p crate`); `COMP-08`/`COMP-09` match them by prefix. `--check-drift` also reads `Cargo.toml` path/workspace dependencies. Addresses `SCL-FB-03`, `SCL-FB-04`.
- New [`FEATURE.md`](FEATURE.md) track: changing an already-specified system.
- `Component.test_paths` and `COMP-08` (verification): test evidence for a component that declares `test_paths` must come from files under them. Opt-in; existing specs unaffected. Specs using `test_paths` need a validator that includes it.
- `Component.fakes` and `COMP-09` (verification): a component with `test_paths` needs a fake under them for each required capability.
- `--check-drift` also scans `test_paths` and rejects tests importing other components (use the fakes); `--check-artifacts` verifies `test_paths` and `fakes` exist.
- `--diagram`: data models sit in their owner's layer; persisted ones (`namespace`/`storage_role`) are cylinders, logical-only ones dashed boxes; node IDs are prefixed per kind (`s_`, `l_`, `c_`, `d_`), so a component named like its layer renders.
- New [`examples/components/`](examples/components/README.md): standalone components with their own tests.

## 0.2.0

- `--check-drift --root`: Python imports between components vs `requires`/`bindings`; JSON Schema properties vs data model fields.
- `WIRING.md`: uv install, schema modeline, CI gate, path anchoring, skill link rewrite, adoption guidance.

## 0.1.0

- First release: validator CLI (`system-spec`), JSON Schema, offline `export`, workflows, examples and skills.

- `--diagram` (all kinds) renders top-to-bottom (`graph TB`) instead of left-to-right, so large diagrams stay readable instead of shrinking to the page width (#139).

- `Requirement.proposed` (#135): optional flag for statements not yet agreed; passes the stages as `specified`, reported as `proposed` in the validator output, deferred (never passed) at release.

- `--report coverage` counts requirements per owning component (capabilities and data models roll up to their provider or owner) with a total row; `--diagram hierarchy` shows component totals, groups external components and styles capabilities, data models and externals (#135 comment).

- Adoption feedback (#135): `--diagram hierarchy|risks`, `--report risks|coverage`; `--diagram` nodes sorted by ID (stable across fragment layout); `REF-02` ambiguity names the colliding kinds; GREENFIELD.md § Greenfield with existing design documents (extract requirements, fragment-per-target, `external` components, docs-only target `verification`); spec.md fragment convention.
